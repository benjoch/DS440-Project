# DS440-Project

Our project investigates the efficacy of various machine learning algorithms at detecting fraud in three different areas of financial activity: Credit Card Transactions, Ethereum Network Transactions, and Insurance Claims. The goals of the project can be broken down into two categories: (1) Team Goals and (2) Individual Domain Specific Goals. Our primary Team Goal is to determine whether there is a machine learning algorithm that performs best in all three areas or whether algorithm performance is dependent on the area of financial activity. Our results offer direction for future, more rigorous investigations into machine learning techniques in different transactional contexts and benefit financial firms, individuals, and researchers that have an interest in machine learning applied to transactional data. We use the FLAML (A Fast Library for Automated Machine Learning & Tuning) python package for training, tuning, and evaluating the performance of various different classes of machine learning models. Individual Domain Specific Goals vary between the three team members. Each focuses on one of the three areas of financial activity and conducts an independent analysis on their own dataset.
